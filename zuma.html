    <h1 class="title-center">A-rods guide to eating and drinking out London Season 1</h1>
<br>
    <p class="first-content">Having worked in many cities around the world London, New York, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and south of France.
        I decided to start using my experience having worked in hospilaity to give back to you all :)
        There are many critics out there who ofcourse have their views, 
        but I will giving you from a prospective of someone who has worked many years in the industry and also from a prospective of an everyday person who loves to eat out in many different restaurants, cafes, etc etc.</p>
   
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Deciding where to go </h2>
       <br>
       <div class="content-wrapper">
        <div>
        <p>East London= more hipster and layed back, you will find many street food spots to eat and mingle at 
            also you can find many hiding gems 
            
            <p>West London = covers a large area from Chelsea, notting hill down to Acton.
                you will find a vast amount of different restauants and bars, from more family orienated to restaurants with michelin star(s).
                Amazing pubs especially in the summer (the pub gardens).</p> 
            
            <p> Central= Here you will find again a mixture of hidden spots to your everyday spots to the creme de la creme.
            we or should i say I would be mainly talking about Soho and Mayfair.</p>
            
           <p> South London= more known for its pubs and family friendly spots, but you can find some lovely spots in areas such as Wimbledon village
            Peckham </p>
            
           <p> North London = more laid back with many independent restaurants and bars.</p>

       <h2>Getting around</h2>
       <br>
       <div class="content-wrapper">
        <div>
       <p>Getting around London isn't as hard as many think.
        We have the world famous Underground, coupled with our famous red buses and black taxi's which 
        you can hail down with your hand and shouting "TAXI" :). I just love doing that hehe  </p>
       <p>ALways take into consideraton train strikes which is a pain in the butt, as that will then cause hell on the road and create the horendus London traffic esp. on the weekend.
        Plan ahead</p>

    <h2>Spending/ cost</h2>
    <br>
    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <div>
    <p>Another plan ahead: don't feel shy to look up the restaurant or bar you are considering to
        dine or drink at.</p>
        <p>It's better to know ahead of time if a starter will cost you 6pounds or 13pounds and a main 14 or 25 or even 40.
            Same goes for drinks, many people who visit london believe they will order a beer and it will cost them 2.50 and they the bartender tells them 7. 
            trust me it happens</p>
