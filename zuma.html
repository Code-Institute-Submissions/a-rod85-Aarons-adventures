    <h1 class="title-center">A-rods guide to eating and drinking out London Season 1</h1>
<br>
    <p class="first-content">Having worked in many cities around the world London, New York, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and south of France.
        I decided to start using my experience having worked in hospilaity to give back to you all :)
        There are many critics out there who ofcourse have their views, 
        but I will giving you from a prospective of someone who has worked many years in the industry and also from a prospective of an everyday person who loves to eat out in many different restaurants, cafes, etc etc.</p>
   
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Deciding where to go </h2>
        <br>
        <p>East London= more hipster and layed back, you will find many street food spots to eat and mingle at 
            also you can find many hiding gems 
            
            <p>West London = covers a large area from Chelsea, notting hill down to Acton.
                you will find a vast amount of different restauants and bars, from more family orienated to restaurants with michelin star(s).
                Amazing pubs especially in the summer (the pub gardens).</p> 
            
            <p> Central= Here you will find again a mixture of hidden spots to your everyday spots to the creme de la creme.
            we or should i say I would be mainly talking about Soho and Mayfair.</p>
            
           <p> South London= more known for its pubs and family friendly spots, but you can find some lovely spots in areas such as Wimbledon village
            Peckham </p>
            
           <p> North London = more laid back with many independent restaurants and bars.</p>
        <div class="content-inner">
Chic and stylish. don't be surprised to bump into someone famous like Lewis Hamilton or Frank Lampard.
