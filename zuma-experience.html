        <p>After a short wait we head the bar which is busy with people drinking their cockails, wine and champagnee. The service is plesant friendly and fast. The creativity and speed that the drinks are made is breathe taking its like watching art (Love it) </p>
        <p>After roughly 10mins we are approached and taken to our table, seated comfortably and given our menus. we are asked what our preference is for water "still or sparkling" After we are served our waters we are told the specials of the night which is always good to know and also provided suggestions on the waiters favorites on the menu. (Always good to hear what the waiter favorites are).</p>
        <p>After ordering our drinks we make our order which includes one of the days specials so we are vey excited to see and taste </p>
