    /* Description of the experience in zuma */

    <div class="zuma-experience">
        <h2 class="title-center">A-rods Zuma experience:</h2>

        <p class="text-align-center">On arrival your greeted by the front of house doormen, who welcome you and open the
            magnificant large glass doors.
            upon entering you blown away with the vibrant atmosphere and high energy.
            The decor is slick, sharp and clean cut. We are acknowledge by the zuma front of house who are very busy but
            still make sure you are noticed.
            After a short wait we head the bar which is busy with people drinking their cockails, wine and champagnee.
            The service is plesant friendly and fast. The creativity and speed that the drinks are made is breathe
            taking its like watching art (Love it)
            After roughly 10mins we are approached and taken to our table, seated comfortably and given our menus. we
            are asked what our preference is for water "still or sparkling" After we are served our waters we are told
            the specials of the night which is always good to know and also provided suggestions on the waiters
            favorites on the menu. (Always good to hear what the waiter favorites are).
            After ordering our drinks we make our order which includes one of the days specials so we are vey excited to
            see and taste everything
            We recieve our cocktails and of course are blown away with them, during this time we are enjoying our
            cocktails you can not help but
            take in the chatter and vibraint atmosphere your surrounded in.
            The food arrives as it is ready which is great, first we recieve the sushi and shashimi platter which was to
            die for, sushi was amazing from californian rolls to King Crab and Lobster and the shashimi was so fresh my
            fav was the yellowfin.
            As more of the food arrives you get lost in the food and can not help but smile during every bite of each
            dish you taste!!!!
        </p>

        <p class="text-align-center">The black cod well what can I say 10/10, wagyu sushi, quial eggs sushi with white
            truffle (special gesture from the chef), wagyu tataki with black truffle all amazing and leaving you wanting
            more!!</p>
        <p class="text-align-center">As we finished up the expectional food, the waiter double checks on us, tops up our
            waters while passing a few dessert menus.
            The ease at which the waiter made what seems to be an extra busy night in Zuma is effortless, you are not
            disturbed and your evening with friends is an enjoyment. We even bought a shot for the waiter.

        </p>

        <p class="text-align-center">we proceeded to order desserts we was feeling brave to say the least after the
            amount we ate, but there was no way we was going to pass up the desserts and of course a couple more
            cocktails.
            So we went for the fruit and cake platter and a few chocolate fonden's
            I would recommend this combination as you get the sweet and rich with the fonden and the light freshness
            with the fruit and cake platter.</p>
