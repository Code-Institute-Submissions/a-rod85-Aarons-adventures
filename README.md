**Introduction**

At the beginning of the project I decided on which features should be included to decide on the kind of website I would be producing. I started to scetch out ideas so I visualise this. There after I began with the backend of the project first so i would have that up and running and as I went along i brought he design into play.

**Project Goals**

My goal for the site is to create a user friendly site for everybody who enjoys socialising and going to restaurants and bars, also for those who wish to try out new spots to eat or drink at. The whole idea is that no matter who you are you will be interested, taken in and inspired by the feel and input the user gets from the website and will be longing to visit the location which has been uploaded.

    ⊛ User will want to revisit weekly to see what's new

**User Goals**

**Features**

    ⊛Design Features

    ∙Header The header consists of a Navigation Bar that is consistent over all pages of the site. 
    The Navigation Bar is also sticky so while scrolling it will followbut stay above the content you are viewing.
    Following this are the links for the other pages, 
    when the mouse hoovers over each one there is a lighter grey highlighted so its stands out visually.
    When you click on the link it highlights yellow so there's no doubting which page you have selected to see.

     Underneath that you have a short description explaining the sites purpose.
