title ""A-rods guide eating and drinking out season1 London"
 subtle "places for all to enjoy and experience"

 Having worked in many cities around the world London, New York, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and south of France.
 I decided to start using my experience having worked in hospilaity to give back to you all :)
 There are many critics out there who ofcourse have their views, 
 but I will giving you from a prospective of someone who has worked many years in the industry and also from a prospective of an everyday person who loves to eat out in many different restaurants, cafes, etc etc.

h3> Deciding where to go 

What part of London are you planning on visiting:

East London= more hipster and layed back, you will find many street food spots to eat and mingle at 
also you can find many hiding gems 

West London = covers a large area from Chelsea, notting hill down to Acton.
you will find a vast amount of different restauants and bars, from more family orienated to restaurants with michelin star(s).
Amazing pubs especially in the summer (the pub gardens).

Central= Here you will find again a mixture of hidden spots to your everyday spots to the creme de la creme.
we or should i say I would be mainly talking about Soho and Mayfair.

South London= more known for its pubs and family friendly spots, but you can find some lovely spots in areas such as Wimbledon village
Peckham

North London = more laid back with many independent restaurants and bars.

sub heading Getting around
Getting around London isn't as hard as many think.
We have the world famous Underground, coupled with our famous red buses and black taxi's which 
you can hail down with your hand and shouting "TAXI" :). I just love doing that hehe

ALways take into consideraton train strikes which is a pain in the butt, as that will then cause hell on the road and create the horendus London traffice esp. on the weekend.
Plan ahead
sub heading Spending/ cost 
Another plan ahead: don't feel shy to look up the restaurant or bar you are considering to
dine or drink at.
It's better to know ahead of time if a starter will cost you 6pounds or 13pounds and a main 14 or 25 or even 40.
Same goes for drinks, many people who visit london believe they will order a beer and it will cost them 2.50 and they the bartender tells them 7. 
trust me it happens

Apps

as you proabably know theres many apps out there to use, I would suggest using open table,etc etc etc
You can find deals on them to try out new restuarants or to go to a restaurant you have visited before.
