h3> Deciding where to go 

What part of London are you planning on visiting:

East London= more hipster and layed back, you will find many street food spots to eat and mingle at 
also you can find many hiding gems 

West London = covers a large area from Chelsea, notting hill down to Acton.
you will find a vast amount of different restauants and bars, from more family orienated to restaurants with michelin star(s).
Amazing pubs especially in the summer (the pub gardens).

Central= Here you will find again a mixture of hidden spots to your everyday spots to the creme de la creme.
we or should i say I would be mainly talking about Soho and Mayfair.

South London= more known for its pubs and family friendly spots, but you can find some lovely spots in areas such as Wimbledon village
Peckham

North London =
