            Having worked in many cities around the world London, New York, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and south
            of France.
            I decided to start using my experience having worked in hospilaity to give back to you all :)
            There are many critics out there who ofcourse have their views,

            a prospective of an everyday person who loves to eat out in many different restaurants, cafes, etc etc.</p>
