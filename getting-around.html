                    <p>East London = More hipster and layed back, you will find many street food spots to eat and mingle
                        at
                        also you can find many hiding gems

                    <p>West London = Covers a large area from Chelsea, Notting Hill down to Acton.
                        you will find a vast amount of different restauants and bars, from more family orienated to
                        restaurants with michelin star(s).
                        Amazing pubs especially in the summer (the pub gardens).</p>

                    <p> Central= Here you will find again a mixture of hidden spots to your everyday spots to the creme
                        de la creme.
                        we or should I say I would be mainly talking about Soho and Mayfair.</p>

                    <p> South London= More known for its pubs and family friendly spots, but you can find some lovely
                        spots in areas such as Wimbledon village
                        Peckham </p>

                    <p> North London = More laid back with many independent restaurants and bars.</p>

                    <p>Getting around London isn't as hard as many think.
                        We have the world famous Underground, coupled with our famous red buses and black taxi's which
                        you can hail down with your hand and shouting "TAXI" :). I just love doing that hehe </p>
                    <p>ALways take into consideraton train strikes which is a pain in the butt, as that will then cause
                        hell on the road and create the horendus London traffic esp. on the weekend.
                        Plan ahead</p>

            <div class="london-wrapper">
                <div>
                    <p>Another plan ahead: don't feel shy to look up the restaurant or bar you are considering to
                        dine or drink at.</p>
                    <p>It's better to know ahead of time if a starter will cost you £6 or £13 and a main £14 or £25 or
                        even £40.
                        Same goes for drinks, many people who visit london believe they will order a beer and it will
                        cost them £2.50 and they the bartender tells them £7.
                        trust me it happens</p>
